				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol start="125">
<li>Did you know that Québec’s energy is 99% renewable? Hydropower is the province’s main generator of energy, and natural gas is used to produce the remaining 1%. The hydroelectric generating stations produce 100 times less greenhouse gas than coal-fired power stations. Also, Canada is the second largest hydroelectricity producer in the world as of 2014 and accounts for nearly 60% of this country’s energy supply.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="126">
<li>Carrie Best was a poet, writer, journalist and activist, and in 1946, she founded Nova Scotia’s first Black owned and published newspaper called <em>The Clarion</em>. From 1952 to 1964, she hosted radio program called <em>Quiet Corner.</em> In 1979, she received the Order of Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="127">
<li>The first organized ice hockey game in Canada was held in Montréal in 1875, after McGill University student J.G.A. Creighton established a set of game rules. McGill also had the world’s first official hockey team. For the hat trick, McGill also won the first “world championship” in 1883.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="128">
<li>Near Selkirk, MB, you’ll find the only stone fort still intact in North America: Fort Garry. Situated in Fort Garry National Park, this fort was built by the Hudson’s Bay Company in the 1830s. It was a strategic place for the fur trade, as well as a jumping off point to get to the Northwest Territories. The fort was also a training camp for the RCMP, a prison and a mental institution.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="129">
<li>Want authentic Mexican food? Go to Winkler, AB. This town is home to the descendants of 6,000 Mennonites who went to Chihuahua, México in the 1920s.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="130">
<li>Little Limestone Lake in Manitoba is the world’s largest and best example of a marl lake. Marl is calcium carbonate, and this lake is rich with it. When the water gets warm, the calcium converts to calcite and turns the water a milky turquoise. When the water gets cold, the calcite dissolves and the water is crystal clear.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="131">
<li>In Timmins, ON, you’ll find the world’s oldest pool of water. At 2 miles below sea level in a base metal mine is a pool of water that University of Toronto geoscientists have dated at 2 billion years old.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="132">
<li>Below the busy streets of Toronto is PATH, the world’s largest underground shopping complex, according to Guinness World Records. PATH has 17 miles worth of tunnels and around the same amount of retail space as West Edmonton Mall.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are wanting to mark Canada’s 150<sup>th</sup> by taking a Canadian vacation. Great in theory, but Canada is nearly 10 million square kilometres big, so how do you narrow down your options? We’ve come up with one unique spot per province and territory that are real contenders for vacation destinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Whitehorse, Yukon</h4>
<p>In 1947, Martin Berrigan created a great example of Canadian urban apartments: log skyscrapers. They were built to help accommodate military personnel and construction workers who were in Whitehorse to build a highway, airports and a pipeline. In 2000, they became a Municipal Historic Site.</p>
<p><a href="http://register.yukonhistoricplaces.ca/Place/3239"><em>register.yukonhistoricplaces.ca/Place/3239</em></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories</h4>
<p>People say “hello” to spring with the Long John Jamboree. Vehicles park on the frozen lake to enjoy events such as the ugly truck and dog contest, snow volleyball tournament and igloo building competition.</p>
<p><a href="http://longjohnjamboree.ca"><em>longjohnjamboree.ca</em></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Auyuittuq National Park, Nunavut</h4>
<p>This park is home to the world’s most vertical drop. Mount Thor has a drop of 4,101 feet and an angle at approximately 105 degrees. The mount itself towers at 5,495 feet and is very popular with climbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://nunavuttourism.com/things-to-see-do/camping-hiking"><em>nunavuttourism.com/things-to-see-do/camping-hiking</em></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Qualicum Beach, British Columbia</h4>
<p>Tom Chudleigh designed three spherical, self-contained rooms suspended from trees. The large windows allow people to watch nature all around them and fall asleep looking at the stars. Book early, or just take a tour.</p>
<p><a href="http://freespiritspheres.com"><em>freespiritspheres.com</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Medicine Lake, Alberta</h4>
<p>This lake feeds the nearby Maligne Canyon through one of the world’s most extensive, natural underground water systems. Meltwater collects in the Maligne Valley and refills the lake. By autumn, it pretty much disappears. It has great fishing and is a prime location to see all sorts of large wildlife.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/medicine-lake-2004/">www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/medicine-lake-2004/</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cypress Hills Inter-Provincial Park, Saskatchewan</h4>
<p>The park is great for the equestrian. Cypress Hills Riding Academy offers guided horseback tours over backcountry trails. The area also caters to campers who want to bring their own horses.</p>
<p><a href="http://cypresshills.com"><em>cypresshills.com</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Winnipeg, Manitoba</h4>
<p>The Canadian Museum of Human Rights is the first of its kind in Canada. Its goal is to show the transition of human rights in Canada and the world. This is enhanced with the entrance being at ground level where it’s dark; as you ascend, each level becomes brighter.</p>
<p><a href="http://humanrights.ca"><em>humanrights.ca</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pelham, Ontario</h4>
<p>One of Canada’s symbols is about 540 years old. The Comfort Sugar Maple is 80 feet tall and has a 20 foot trunk circumference, making it Canada’s largest sugar maple. It’s been struck by lightning at least once and is currently affected by rot, so don’t wait too long to see this remarkable tree.</p>
<p><a href="http://npca.ca/conservation-areas/comfort-maple"><em>npca.ca/conservation-areas/comfort-maple</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sainte-Flavie, Québec</h4>
<p>Canadian artist Marcel Gagnon has carved over 100 man-sized wooden and stone figures and has placed them at varying depths along the St. Lawrence River’s shoreline. His art project is called <em>Le Grand Rassemblement</em>. The figures are revealed and immersed at every tide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.centredart.net/le-grand-rassemblement"><em>www.centredart.net/le-grand-rassemblement</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bell Island, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador</h4>
<p>This was one of the rare places in North America that was directly attacked during WWII. German U-Boats sunk four iron ore ships in 1942. For divers, this area of Conception Bay offers great diving among the intact ships (apart from the torpedo holes), as well as seeing a variety of marine life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oceanquestadventures.com"><em>www.oceanquestadventures.com</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Hartland, New Brunswick</h4>
<p>People don’t need Madison County to get their fill of covered bridges. They’ll find not only a covered bridge but also the world’s longest covered bridge in Hartland. It spans 1,282 feet across the St. John River, and was built in 1901. The cover, however, wasn’t added until 1922.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.town.hartland.nb.ca/html/bridge.html"><em>www.town.hartland.nb.ca/html/bridge.html</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Halifax, Nova Scotia</h4>
<p>What’s now the Five Fisherman’s Restaurant used to be a mortuary until 1973. The Snow &amp; Company Undertakers took in bodies from two well-knows disasters: <em>R.M.S. Titanic</em> and the Halifax explosion. Today, Five Fisherman’s reportedly serves some of the best food in the city.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fivefishermen.com"><em>www.fivefishermen.com</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Abrams Village, Prince Edward Island</h4>
<p>The L’Exposition agricole et le Festival acadien has been an annual event for 114 years. It was started by the Urbainville Village Farmers’ Club in 1903. The festival celebrates everything Acadian along with a rubber boot throwing championship, lobster suppers and a strong-women competition.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="117">
<li>The Confederation Bridge is the longest bridge in the world that crosses ice-covered water. Its total length is 12.9 km and consists of 3 parts: the East Approach, the West Approach and the Main Bridge. When it was being built, the dredged-up material was purposefully redeposited in non-productive areas of the Northumberland Strait as part of the Lobster Habitat Enhancement Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="118">
<li>Cosmetic company Lise Watier is Canadian. Lise Watier was one of the first women to break into and be successful in the Canadian cosmetics industry. She began by founding the Lise Watier Institute where the main focus was to help build the self-confidence of Québec women by educating them about beauty, personal well-being and growth. There’s also the Lise Watier Foundation, which is a charity that helps women, especially those in poverty, to empower themselves. In 2016, the company merged with the Groupe Marcelle, Inc., to become the largest Canadian cosmetic company.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="119">
<li>There are about two dozen confirmed impact craters in Canada ranging from 3 km to 95 km in diameter. The two largest are in Sudbury, ON, at 140 km in diameter, and in Manicouagan, QB, at 100 km in diameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="120">
<li>In the early 40s, Dr. Wilfred Bigelow, a Canadian surgeon and hypothermia researcher, found a way to increase the safety of heart surgeries when he discovered that a lower body temperature reduced the body’s oxygen requirements. With the help of Dr. John Callaghan of the Toronto General Hospital, he deliberately lowered the body temperature of a heart patient to do the first open-heart surgery on a human. Without this discovery, open-heart surgery wouldn’t be possible, as surgeons wouldn’t be able to stop the blood flow to see what they were doing without causing serious damage to the patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="121">
<li>Diamonds weren’t discovered in Canada until the 1990s. The Ekati Mine in the Northwest Territory started operations in 1998 and is Canada’s first diamond mine. The Diavik Mine, 35 km southeast of Ekati, started operations in 2002 and is Canada’s largest diamond mine in terms of carat production. Both mines adhere to this country’s strict environmental standards, which are the world’s most rigorous. The <em>CanadaMark </em>hallmark is a certified diamond of 0.20 carats or larger that has a diamond identification number (DIN) and certificate that allow the purchaser to track the diamond from mine to store in an effort to reduce the availability of conflict diamonds in the marketplace.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="122">
<li>In 1973, Vic Mercredi was the first person from the Northwest Territories drafted into the NHL. What was also unique about Mercredi was that he played with a neutral stick (no curve/hook) because he could play left- or right-handed.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="123">
<li>The Migratory Bird Sanctuary (MBS) at Last Mountain Lake, SK, is Canada’s first bird reserve, as well as North America’s first bird sanctuary. The sanctuary began June, 1887, with approximately 2500 acres at the north end of the lake. It wasn’t named Last Mountain Lake MBS until 1917 when Canada and the States enacted the Migratory Birds Convention Act—the first countries in the world to sign such an agreement. Now at nearly 12,000 acres, over 300 bird species have been recorded there, of which over 110 species use the sanctuary as a breeding ground.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="124">
<li>There are two very small animals that make their homes in this rather large country. The smallest bird in Canada is the Calliope hummingbird, which weighs 2.5 g and is 7 cm long. It lives in central British Columbia and southwestern Alberta. The smallest mammal in North America is the pygmy shrew, which weighs about 12 g and is about 6 cm long. It lives mainly in eastern Canada.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“To Serve the </strong>Community’s Greatest Need.” That’s the motto of the St. Albert Kinette Club, a local charitable organization that is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. In those five decades of community service, the club has more than lived up to its motto. And though the Kinettes originally formed as the female counterpart to the Kinsmen Club, it’s been clear from the very start that the Kinettes were never just a supplementary charity group—they’re a successful, charitable organization in their own right.</p>
<h3>1960s</h3>
<p>The St. Albert Kinette Club held its first official meeting on November 8, 1966, where its 14 members, led by Mrs. Jeanne Irwin, sat down to decide what form their club would take. Their decision? To model it after other Canadian Kinette Clubs across the country—but with a slight twist. Unlike the other Kinette Clubs that often acted as auxiliary organizations that supported the projects of their male counterparts (the Kinsmen), the St. Albert Kinettes decided they would do things differently: In addition to providing support to their husbands, they would organize and host projects on their own.</p>
<p>The first of these independent Kinette projects was the Christmas Food Hamper, a project that continues to run every holiday season. In their first year, the Kinettes managed to produce hampers for 35 families in need.</p>
<p>Other early projects included Kinette-run public speaking courses for the women of St. Albert, programs for schools and youth groups and their own regular movie night called Kincinema.</p>
<h3>1970s</h3>
<p>In 1970, the Kinette Club made their first sizable donation to the community. They had raised over $600 from their Kincinema project and used the money to furnish the waiting rooms of the newly built Sturgeon Hospital.</p>
<p>This was only the first of many collaborations the Kinettes would have with Sturgeon Hospital. In the next few years they would begin to organize blood drives and raise money for research on both cystic fibrosis and heart disease.</p>
<p>The 1970s also saw the Kinettes take on a much bigger role in the annual Rainmaker Rodeo, a project that was traditionally run by the Kinsmen Club of St. Albert. The Kinettes helped with the rodeo preparations, sold tickets and acted as organizers and judges of the Rainmaker Parade and Rodeo Queen contest.</p>
<h3>1980s</h3>
<p>While the Kinettes in St. Albert had always had their own community projects separate from those of the Kinsmen, they weren’t actually a fully independent organization. In fact, none of the Kinette Clubs in Canada were. Traditionally, to become a Kinette, a woman had to be the wife or daughter of a Kinsman. But this changed in 1988 when Kin Canada ruled that a woman’s membership did not have to be tied to that of a male relative. This ruling also granted Kinette Clubs across the country the right to manage their own finances and found new Kinette Clubs in communities without waiting for a Kinsmen Club to be founded first.</p>
<h3>2000s</h3>
<p>In 2002, the Kinettes expanded their annual Christmas Hamper program to include the new “Fill-A-Bus” initiative. During the first year, they managed to completely fill two city buses with food, toys, and monetary donations for families in need. In 2003, they added a third bus to ensure that there would be enough room for the incoming donations. Before long, they started using double-long, bendable buses to keep up.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Today, the St. Albert Kinette Club faces more difficult challenges than they have in the past. The economy is not what it once was, and the donations they are able to collect reflect that fact. The need for charity is up, and there aren’t as many people who can give. Nevertheless, the Kinettes dutifully continue their efforts to serve the greatest need of the community, whatever that need may be. <u>t8n</u></p>
<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>In their first year running the Christmas Hamper, the Kinette Club managed to collect enough food to feed 35 families. These days, the Kinettes collect enough to feed between 200 and 300 local families during each holiday season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
<p>The first Kinette Club was founded in 1942, and today, there are 146 Kinette Clubs spread across Canada. Since their creation, they and their Kinsmen counterparts have raised over 1 billion dollars for Canadian charitable causes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4499" src="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_278-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_278-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_278-501x750.jpg 501w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_278.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />There’s something so </strong>special about a bright, beautiful July day. Maybe it’s the warmth of the sun, the gentle summer breeze or the smell of freshly cut grass, but we feel nature all around us. We yearn to escape the city’s hectic pace, forget our troubles and take in the outdoors—even if only for a few hours.</p>
<p>A short drive from St. Albert (45 minutes east, to be exact), we find Elk Island National Park. Picturesque and just plain awesome, this 194-square-kilometre park is a Canadian wilderness wonderland. Whether you’re looking for adventure, seeking serenity or thirsting for knowledge, a trip to Elk Island National Park is an experience you’ll surely savour. And with Canada’s 150th birthday upon us, there’s no better excuse to get out and explore one of our country’s natural marvels. Here we go behind the scenes at Elk Island National Park. Take a look!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-4494 alignleft" src="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05282017_133-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05282017_133-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05282017_133-501x750.jpg 501w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05282017_133.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />The Elk Island story begins in 1906, when five Albertans from Fort Saskatchewan convinced the Canadian government to create a wildlife sanctuary for elk, which were being wiped out by hunters. “Elk Park,” a 42-square-kilometre area around what is now Astotin Lake, became Canada’s first federally run, big-game sanctuary.</p>
<p>Since then, Elk Island National Park has become Canada’s largest, fully fenced national park. According to Robyn O’Neill, Partnering, Engagement &amp; Communications Officer for Elk Island National Park, the park has not only grown in size but also in its conservation efforts. “We are well-known for our very crucial role in the conservation of the plains bison—the species was nearly lost forever. But we’ve also done other conservation work, such as with wood bison and the trumpeter swan. We are very proud of our heritage here at Elk Island.”</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4500" src="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_519-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_519-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_519-501x750.jpg 501w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05312017_519.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />Today, Elk Island National Park is not only a refuge for animals but also for people.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hiking, biking and walking are really big out here,”says O’Neill.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We have 80 kilometres of trail. A nice short one is Living Waters Boardwalk, or you can go for 18.6 kilometres on the Wood Bison Trail.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to O’Neill, geocaching is also a popular activity at the park. “We have 11 geocaching sites hidden around the park. Visitors can pick up supplies at the Visitor Centre, free of charge.”</p>
<p>If you want to get off the land and into the water, look to Astotin Lake.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Lots of canoeing and kayaking happen on Astotin Lake,” says O’Neill. “You can bring your own equipment or rent it on-site from Haskin Canoe Rentals.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-4498 alignleft" src="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05302017_042-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05302017_042-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05302017_042-501x750.jpg 501w, http://www.t8nmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/05302017_042.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />Of all the fun activities to enjoy, O’Neill says watching the wildlife is one of her highlights.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If seeing a bison isn’t on your bucket list, it should be. It’s truly a majestic creature. And Elk Island is also a bird-lover’s paradise. We have over 250 species of birds at the park. Everything from ducks and geese to rare birds like the great crested flycatcher and the broad-winged hawk.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When you visit Elk Island National Park, the beauty around you is apparent. Look a little closer, however, and you’ll appreciate all the work that happens behind the scenes. The park has a dedicated team of interpreters, conservation experts, asset-management specialists, maintenance and administrative staff and so many more. “It takes a variety of people and all kinds of roles to keep the park running. Ultimately, wildlife and visitor-safety are the most important things to us,” says O’Neill.</p>
<p>With wildlife roaming freely, tons of outdoorsy activities to try and so much to learn and explore, what are you waiting for? It’s time to experience Elk Island National Park! <u>t8n</u></p>

Arriving in Canada in 2004, Debesay worked a mélange of jobs for more than 10 years before his passion for food led him to the restaurant business and the opening of Saviour’s in November of last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“To be honest, I love cooking,” Debesay explains, “but I didn’t go to school for it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Debesay learned how to prepare dishes in his native Ethiopia, where he taught high school for a living. When he came to Canada, he brought with him his love for cooking, which served him well when his family followed in 2011. “When they came here, as immigrants like me, I started cooking for them,” he says. It would be some years later, however, before Debesay would put his culinary skills to use professionally.</p>
<p>Settling first in Edmonton and then in St. Albert, Debesay worked jobs as a glasscutter, a Mac’s cashier and a bread-delivery driver—in addition to running a janitorial service. It was during his time as a driver, from 2006 to 2016, that he came to know St. Albert. “It’s a good place to live,” he says of the city he now calls home. “The people are very nice.”</p>
<p>Like Debesay himself, the concept for Saviour’s has also gone through something of a journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I first came to open Saviour’s Café, I was trying to go all Italian,” Debesay recalls.</p></blockquote>
<p>But taking note of all the other Italian restaurants in town, he reconsidered. Keeping some of the Italian, he added a few East African dishes to the mix. “I have Italian pizza, all my pastries are Italian and I have cappuccino and macchiato, so it’s a mixture of Italian and African,” he says of the restaurant now. Though the pairing may not seem obvious, it’s also not as strange as it might sound. As Debesay points out, Ethiopia was once briefly colonized by Italy, and even today, pasta is a common food there.</p>
<p>However, as appetizing as the panini and tiramisu look, the African element is what really sets Saviour’s apart. The restaurant serves up traditional fare such as <em>tibs</em> (sautéed meat and veggies) and slow-cooked wot (thick stew or curry). These are eaten by hand using injera, a sourdough flatbread. Made from teff, an iron-rich grain that mainly grows in Ethiopia and Eritrea, injera is absolutely central to the cuisines of those countries. It comes to the table in rolls, from which diners tear off hand-sized portions to eat with. The bread’s spongy, elastic texture is perfect for picking up food and sopping up juices, and its slightly lemony taste is a nice complement to the savoury fillings.</p>
<p>Another can’t-miss highlight at Saviour’s is the coffee ceremony. Coffee is believed to be native to the Ethiopian Highlands, and the drink has great cultural significance there. It is served after meals in a special clay pot called a <em>jebena</em>, which keeps the coffee warm for a long time so that drinkers can take their time chatting over it. Debesay adds ginger to his espresso-like brew (giving it a little bite) and serves popcorn as a light accompaniment. In acknowledgement that coffee drinking is a social activity in Ethiopia, the coffee service at Saviour’s is meant for at least two people. Those eating solo will have to stick with the regular coffee (which is also pretty darn good).</p>
<p>The positive response to Saviour’s has given Debesay confidence that his foray into the restaurant industry has been a wise one. On Facebook, TripAdvisor and Yelp, it’s been one five-star review after another. That feedback is something that means a lot to Debesay.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the customers come, they encourage me,” says Debesay. “Especially people in St. Albert, they’re the best people. They’re so encouraging.” <u>t8n</u></p></blockquote>
<h3>InJera 101</h3>
<p>In Ethiopia, injera is made entirely from gluten-free teff. But here, a little barley and whole wheat are often added. Debesay is working on obtaining <em>injera</em> made with teff and rice, which will be 100% gluten free.</p>

<p><strong>The story of</strong> this signature Canadian dish begins with its quixotic invention in 1950’s Quebec and continues to be shaped by a variety of multicultural influences. Some say there’s only one way to make it—fries, cheese curds and gravy—but here are eight celebration-worthy versions that beg to differ. To each their own—poutine!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Canadian Brewhouse</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Around 2002, this Alberta chain seemed destined for dive-bar status. But when the company undertook a major image overhaul, refabbing its restaurants and completely overhauling its menus, Canadian Brewhouse emerged with one of the most impressive selections of food and drink of any chain on the market. And that includes their multitude of poutine selections—seven, to be exact. We tried the braised-beef version hoping that you couldn’t go wrong with tender, slow-cooked beef and a little BBQ sauce topping off a soup of gravy, cheese and fries. We were right. The perfect drink pairing? Two words: Osoyoos Caesar.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Delux Burger Bar</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not unusual for bars to serve poutine, but Delux Burger Bar at The Shops at Boudreau in St. Albert serves one of the best-looking and most generously sized versions around. The gravy, of which they are certainly generous in offering, has great flavour, though (if you’re going to be picky) is not as hearty as the competition’s. What can’t be beat? Chasing it down with a $5 draft while catching a Jay&#8217;s game on the big screen.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Dixie Lee</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A fried-chicken chain in eastern Canada since the 1960s, Dixie Lee established an Edmonton beachhead in 2016 with its Whyte Avenue location. Ringers in the poutine sweepstakes, Dixie Lee even does something that westerners don’t: they call gravy “poutine sauce.”</p>
<p>Served in a metal bowl, with crisp, fried potatoes, seemingly unmeltable cheese curds and just enough gravy—whoops!—“poutine sauce.” In fact, they seemed to know, down to the nanolitre, exactly how much sauce to use. If you are a transplanted Easterner, chances are you’ll love this place.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Goldrush Eatery</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some people insist that poutine be made with cheese curds. But not at the Goldrush Eatery. Located in the Standard Life Centre in Edmonton since 1982, Goldrush uses shredded cheese to produce a formidable poutine. Gravy can be like nectar of the gods, and Goldrush has come close to crafting their own version. It’s salty enough to hit the spot, but not so much that you need to chase it with litres of water. The shredded mozza virtually liquifies into the gravy, creating a sumptuous pool of deliciousness. If the word poutine does mean “mess” in French slang, Goldrush wins the prize for the most accurate representation.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Jack’s Burger Shack</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Founded in Slave Lake in 2012, Jack’s Burger Shack relocated to its current Perron St. location in 2013 and has since expanded into Edmonton. Given that co-owner Tu Le was featured on an episode of <em>Chopped Canada</em> last year, it’s no surprise that the food is tasty and thoughtfully prepared. Their gravy is rich, hardy and flavourful, and they stay true to the origins of the dish by using cheese curds. The more adventurous might want to double down by pairing this with their Quebecker burger, which uses poutine as the sandwich’s main topping.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Jack’s Drive-In</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Spruce Grove landmark dating back nearly 60 years, Jack’s Drive-In matches Tim Hortons in drive-thru-line insanity. In fact, by 2 p.m. you can expect to see vehicles snaking well out onto the adjacent frontage road. This is a sign of success, and poutine is part of the equation. Jack’s version opts for shredded cheese, and while that doesn’t follow the traditional canon, it makes for a respectable and resolutely messy version. In the (unlikely) chance you’ve never heard about Jack’s multi-flavoured soft-serve ice cream, you’ll want to make sure you leave with some of that, too.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> La Poutine</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking to step outside the chain shop experience? La Poutine, located in Edmonton since 2011, is the place to go for traditional poutine, as well as inspired versions you won’t find other places. We settled in for a creation that subs in chili, sour cream and chopped green onions. Simple, scrumptious and reminiscent of “Texas Fries.” Come here if you’re craving the unexpected.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Simply Donairs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This Mediterranean diner with a misnomer for a name—there’s more to their menu than donairs—is located at 388 St. Albert Trail, and they know their way around poutineland. Simply the best taste and value of all the joints reviewed here. A small sized donair poutine—we’d hate to see a large—included tomatoes, onions, donair meat and sweet sauce—in addition to—the standard gravy and cheese. C’est vraiment magnifique. This place had a lineup going the entire time. One taste and you’ll know why. <u>t8n</u></p>

Just ask Canadian bestselling author Corinne Jeffery. The long-time educator and St. Albert resident didn’t turn to writing until she was nearing retirement. But her story, the <em>Understanding Ursula</em> trilogy, had been with her all her life. “My trilogy follows my journey,” Jeffery says of the books—<em>Arriving, Thriving, and Choosing</em>—which span 80 years and several generations of a family on the Canadian prairies. The books have sold thousands of copies and attracted a following of dedicated readers. T8N recently sat down with Jeffery to talk about her books and her second career as an author.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> When did you know you wanted to be a writer?</p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>My brother was a year older than me. He went to school and stayed with my grandparents, and I thought that was so sad because I wanted to go to school—I have always loved school. He would bring his <em>Dick and Jane</em> books home, and I was actually reading them sooner than he was. The minute I started to read, I knew that words were my medium. They always have been. And so, by the age of seven, I was telling everybody that I wanted to write a book. Of course, nobody took me seriously.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> You had a lengthy career before you turned to writing. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><strong>CJ:</strong> I grew up in an impoverished, dysfunctional family, and I knew it was very difficult to make a living as an author. In my day, there was teaching and nursing. So I became a nurse […] I earned enough money and got bursaries and scholarships and went to the University of Manitoba and completed a three-year nursing degree. Since then, I’ve been in education. But my book was always with me, at the back of my mind. When I was 57, I started to write. By 67, I had three published books, and before I turned 68, I was a bestselling author.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> Why did you begin writing <em>Arriving</em> when you did?</p>
<p><strong>CJ:</strong> It actually started as a healing journey. I wasn’t planning to do anything with it, but my daughter would read over my shoulder and say, “Mom, what are you going to do with this?” And I’d say, “Nothing. This is for me.” Writing has always been for me; I’m very selfish in that. I think most writers are, quite frankly. It takes you to a zone. I lose myself, my characters become real and I need to find out what happens with them.</p>
<p>I really had two primary purposes, other than this healing journey. Because I’m never without one or two books on the go, I kept thinking, “Where are all the really good Canadian stories?” So that was one of the things I wanted to do—write a Canadian story. Because I think we are as interesting and as intriguing as every other nation of people. But the other thing I wanted to do was to immortalize the real, ordinary Canadian. You and me, not the rich and the famous and the sports stars and the politicians, the people who get all the press.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> When did you finish writing the trilogy? What was that like?</p>
<p><strong>CJ:</strong> I started to write it in the summer of 2002, and I finished it on March 3, 2011. It was nine years of writing. I got up that morning, about 7 o’clock. I sat down at about 7:30, started to write, and wrote the entire epilogue. By 5:30 p.m. I was finished. It was incredible; it just kept coming. I love the<br />
epilogue… you see, [the trilogy] starts with the prologue, and in the epilogue, eighty years later, I bring it all back together. It’s a full circle. I think writers have muses, but I also think we have some divine intervention. In whatever you believe, there is intervention. My epilogue proved that to me.</p>
<p><strong>t8n: </strong>How would you describe your writing style?</p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>I’m a very visual person, and I take you right to the scene. And you’re there; you will know these people. That’s how I write. I have to be at the scene. If I’m not in that scene with my characters, it’s not going. Once I’m completely fluent with them, then my story unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> What do you think is the importance or the appeal of pioneer stories like yours?</p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>Our world is moving so fast and we’re losing so much of our history. [<em>Understanding Ursula</em>] covers that pioneer experience. I didn’t focus on the hardships and the difficulties—we all know it had to be tremendously hard. I focused on the people. I’m a people person.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> How have your readers responded to <em>Understanding Ursula?</em></p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>I have people now who have read it three times. I have people asking for a prequel, a sequel, and a cookbook. I’ve come to the conclusion that they like <em>Arriving</em> best because of the pace, the simplicity, the connection between God and man and nature. And people, and the cooperation. We’re losing all of that. That’s another irony: the so-called telecommunications that’s supposed to improve communication is actually putting<br />
a huge wedge between people.</p>
<p><strong>t8n: </strong>Tell us about <em>Lords and Lepers</em>, the novel you are currently working on.</p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>It’s a coming-of-age social commentary. I’m taking four young women, right from youth, adolescence, and into adulthood. [My idea] when I started this book was that in today’s world, all too often, we are valued for what we have and for what we do rather than for who we are… Alberta is a very materialistic place. It comes with all the opportunities and advantages we have in this country, and the money we have.</p>
<p><strong>t8n:</strong> Has writing this book been different than writing Understanding Ursula?</p>
<p><strong>CJ: </strong>Absolutely. [<em>Understanding Ursula</em>] was in my heart and my mind and my soul waiting to get out all my life. It’s based on real people. But [<em>Lords and Lepers</em>] has been more difficult because it’s pure imagination. But I’m having a great deal of fun with it. <u>t8n</u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting nutritional advice in a grocery store seems like such a natural service to provide that it’s strange to think it’s a relatively new concept. Today, people are more informed about their health and eating habits, so St. Albert Sobeys decided it was time to offer free nutritional advice to its customers. For nearly two years, the Wellbeing Department (situated right by the pharmacy) has been offering everything you need to take charge of your overall health—from sports nutrition products to expert advice from Laura Johnston, St. Albert Sobeys Wellbeing Counsellor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laura sources a lot of the natural foods and supplements you find in the Wellbeing Department. So, if you have a question about allergen-containing foods, dairy substitutes or have been diagnosed celiac, she can answer all of your questions on how to supplement your diet to keep you healthy. St. Albert Sobeys has the largest gluten-free section north of Red Deer, as well as one of the best dairy-free selections in the area. Why? “St. Albert residents really care about their health; they’re more in-tuned with their bodies and recognize they may have an allergy or an intolerance. People here are ready to choose products to treat their symptoms,” explains Laura.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research has shown that humans are creatures of habit, and we’re no different when we go grocery shopping. People take the same route within the store when they choose their groceries. For this reason, the Wellbeing Department team offers tours of the store to show customers what else is available. If you’re on a weight-loss program or need to modify your diet due to a medical condition, Laura is happy to take you “off the beaten path” and show you where to find the salt or sugar substitutes, or where to find all the different types of protein. If you need a one-on-one consultation, she’s there to help. St. Albert Sobeys also offers workshops and seminars such as a four-week weight-loss program at Servus Place. Laura also helps local athletes and sports teams on how to keep fuelled during and after exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wellbeing Department isn’t just a gimmick to keep up with today’s food fads. The Sobeys team truly believes in the Sobeys motto, “Eat better, feel better, do better.” And when people have access to contradictory information from the Internet, TV shows, and friends and family, it’s nice to know that someone like Laura is here to answer all your questions about supplements, gluten-free products, alternative health food products and more—and her advice is free, no purchase necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Laura has a Food Science and Nutrition Degree from the U of A and a Natural Nutrition Diploma from the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition, which makes her a certified holistic nutrition consultant. She’s also a triathlete, so she’s uniquely qualified to answer questions about the sports supplement lines carried by Sobeys.</p>
