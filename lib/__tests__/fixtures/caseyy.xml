Moreover, she makes the case convincingly that the bizarre results of algorithms gone awry disproportionately affect the lives of the poor and disadvantaged.</p>

The downside of immutability is that it&#39;s hard to do: familiar methods like <code>.push</code> modify arrays in place instead of producing and new ones, and even when trying to &quot;think immutable&quot; it&#39;s easy to mess up and modify and existing data structure.</p>

It can only come from reason, from experimentation, or from preexisting knowledge. Yet throughout the history of our civilisation, those in positions have power have claimed access to greater versions of knowledge, whether through divine revelation, or through being &quot;like, really smart.&quot;</p>
